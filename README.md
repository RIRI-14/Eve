## About
An app that requires the user to enter some specifications on scales regarding your music preferences based on year-of-release, genre, danceability, instrumentalness, modality, tempo, popularity, and valance; suggests six initial songs, that can be played in the iframe player or directly in the Spotify App. One can login the Spotify application or share the songs across various platforms as per their wish. The app consumes the Spotify and Genius API, along with Kaggle Dataset. One can click on recommend more songs to get six more recommendations for the same inputs. It uses the 'k-Nearest neighbour' machine learning algorithm, Content-based filtering, and Collaborative-filtering, to sort the top songs for the requirements set. In a real time environment, these are the algorithms used by the Spotify application to recommend songs to each user.
